# Data Science Portfolio
## By Antonio Manuel Gonz√°lez Ferreira

All materials in the present are part of the developing of the project under the name Anomaly Detection in Maritime Vessels Traffic done in cooperation with Saab Technologies. In this repository you will find my contributions to the  project during the minor in Applied Data Science @ The Hague University of Applied Data Sciences. 

All the code generated during the semester has been writen in _Python_, more precisely using _Jupyter Notebooks_. Hereunder you will find links to those in which I have taken part with explanations in more detail on the referenced files. Thus, this document serves as a index guideline.

_**Note**: One of the python packages used for visualizations preceding the final prototype is _iPyLeaflet_. The maps generated by this in-line geodata library are not available any more after having saved the notebook so some visualizations will be linked to a HTML file or a picture._

- ### Introduction to the project
##### Project's Value
	Over the past decades there has been a significant rise in maritime traffic. This means that managing this traffic is an increasingly difficult task due to the amount of data that needs to be processed.
	Unfortunately, by the time the sea routes are becoming more congested, most of the managing methods and prococols (traditionally hand-operated) are overwhelming operators arising a descent on its efficiency.
	Data science has a lot to do to improve the maritime services and vigilance and Anomaly Detection is a really valuable field to put research efforts, primarily because of a fact: Unguarded maritime traffic can lead to ilegal trade, fish poaching, collissions that can supose high costs and a long list preventable troubles on harbours.
	There is a lot of literature on the topic but as it is a highly transversal issue, the methods to detect anomalies are not standarized and depend much about the field to which we want to apply it.
